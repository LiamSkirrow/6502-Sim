# 6502-Sim
A Java based 6502 CPU simulator environment

First ever Java project, about 80% of the instruction set has been implemented, I have plans for the future to entirely rewrite this project in Javascript paying attention to more efficient data structures and a better GUI, and split between multiple different source files.
